Sequencing reads from the RNA-seq experiment were processed with a pipeline building upon the implementation of the ENCODE âLong RNA-seqâ pipeline (also described in (Schlager et al., 2020)): filtered reads were mapped against the Homo sapiens (human) genome hg38/GRCh38 (primary assembly, excluding alternate contigs) using the STAR (v2.5.2b) aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) allowing for soft clipping of adapter sequences.   For quantification, we used transcript annotation files from Ensembl version 86, which corresponds to GENCODE 25 for human. Gene expression levels were quantified with the above annotations, using RSEM (v1.3.0) (Li and Dewey, 2011) and featureCounts (v1.5.1) (Liao, Smyth and Shi, 2014). Quality controls were implemented using FastQC (v0.11.5) [ Andrews, S. (2010). FastQC:  A Quality Control Tool for High Throughput Sequence Data [Online].

The only deviation from the manufacturerâs protocol was the use of Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) for double-stranded cDNA purification, instead of the recommended SPRIselect Beads. Final sequencing libraries were quantified by the High Sensitivity dsDNA Quanti-iT Assay Kit (ThermoFisher) on a Synergy HTX (BioTek). mRNA libraries were also assessed for size distribution and adapter dimer presence (<0.5%) by the High Sensitivity Small Fragment DNF-477 Kit on a 48-channel Fragment Analyzer (Agilent).
