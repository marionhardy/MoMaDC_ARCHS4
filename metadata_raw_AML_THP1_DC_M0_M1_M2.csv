The reads were then aligned against the human reference genome (GRCh38 from Ensembl) using HISAT2 v2.0.4, and the read count table was assembled using HTSeq. Subsequent expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 v1.32.0 R package. Principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap plots were assembled using the ggplot2 and pheatmap R packages. For the PCA of the hiPSC-macrophages, data of primary and iPSC-derived myeloid subtypes available from a public dataset were used [34]. For the heatmap analysis, the gene expression of the different conditions of hiPSC-macrophages and hiPSC-neurons relative to their unstimulated counterparts, was determined for the genes implicated in different host response pathways, retrieved from the Host Response Panel of Nanostring (https://nanostring.com/products/ncounter-assays-panels/immunology/host-response/).
